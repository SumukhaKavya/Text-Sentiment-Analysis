# Text-Sentiment-Analysis
The project's GitHub repository contains the code, data, and documentation related to the Text Review Analysis and Rating Prediction project. The repository showcases the following key components:

Data Transformation Code: Python code to extract and transform the raw text data into a structured CSV format.

Data Preprocessing Code: Python code to preprocess the text data, including text cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization.

Model Building Code: Python code to implement various machine learning algorithms for Score prediction.

Jupyter Notebooks: Interactive notebooks demonstrating the step-by-step process of data transformation, preprocessing, and model building.

Documentation: Detailed documentation explaining the project's objectives, methodologies, and insights gained from the analysis.

Through this project, I aimed to gain hands-on experience in Data Engineering, NLP, and Machine Learning while providing valuable insights into product reviews and enhancing decision-making processes.

Feel free to explore the repository for a more in-depth understanding of the project. Your feedback and suggestions are highly appreciated.
